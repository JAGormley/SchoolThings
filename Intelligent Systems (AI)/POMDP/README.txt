    This POMDP-based belief-state updater computes and prints out the belief state of an agent in a grid world after performing a1:n and observing e1:n (i.e., observing each ei after performing the corresponding ai ). The agent isn't sure where she starts, and she doesn't know with certainty what outcome her actions will result in. The table represents the probability that the agent is in a given state cell after performing a series of actions.
